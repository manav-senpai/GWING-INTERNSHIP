# GWING - INTERNSHIP 🔧💻

Yo! This is my submission for the **Gwing Internship Task** — a fully responsive animated navbar, built with nothing but **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript sauce**.  
I didn’t just make it work — I made it look 🔥 with blur, wallpapers, animated dropdown, and some juicy interactions.

## 🧠 What I Built

- AN AESTHETIC responsive navbar  
- Hamburger toggle for mobile  
- Animated menu dropdown with blur & slide-in  
- Wallpaper backgrounds (because boring UIs are illegal)  
- Card-style links with rounded corners  
- Fully mobile-first + desktop clean

## 🧃 Notes

- This project is pure front-end and open to customization  
- I kept class names simple on purpose: `.nav`, `.menuBtn`, `.navLinks`, etc.  
- Feel free to fork, remix, or roast it — I’m always open to feedback 😁

## 🐰 peace.
